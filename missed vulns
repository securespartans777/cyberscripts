Here are some vulnerabilities that are commonly missed by most penetration testers, especially during time-limited or automated engagements:

1. Business Logic Flaws
Example: Bypassing payment steps, escalating privileges by manipulating user roles.

Why it's missed: Tools can't detect these; requires understanding how the app is intended to work.

2. Access Control Issues (IDOR)
Example: Accessing another user's invoice by changing user_id=123 to user_id=124.

Why it's missed: Often overlooked in apps with complex URL schemes or when no sensitive data is visible.

3. Client-Side Validation Bypass
Example: HTML form restricts values (e.g., price fields), but server doesn’t validate them.

Why it's missed: Testers rely on what the browser shows and don’t manually alter requests.

4. SSRF with Subtle Endpoints
Example: PDF generators or image fetchers making internal requests.

Why it's missed: Requires exploring undocumented or hidden features.

5. Race Conditions
Example: Sending multiple simultaneous requests to exploit double-spending or bypass limits.

Why it's missed: Requires threading/scripts and deeper analysis beyond tool scans.

6. Server-Side Misconfigurations (e.g., Debugging Interfaces)
Example: Exposed /debug, /actuator, .git directories.

Why it's missed: Missed due to narrow scope or assumption they’re not in prod.

7. Subdomain Takeover
Example: A DNS entry pointing to a non-existent resource (e.g., AWS S3).

Why it's missed: Not usually part of standard pentest scope; needs DNS and OSINT enumeration.

8. Weak Cryptographic Implementations
Example: Custom JWT signing, using none algorithm, or weak PRNGs.

Why it's missed: Crypto flaws often go unnoticed unless manually reviewed.

9. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
Example: No alerting on brute force or SQL injection attempts.

Why it's missed: Usually out of scope for red-team or web app tests but critical for blue teams.

10. Chained Low-Severity Vulnerabilities
Example: Combining verbose error messages, path traversal, and SSRF to achieve RCE.

Why it's missed: Testers often report findings in isolation instead of thinking about chained impact.

Would you like a custom checklist or script to help you identify these during your engagements?

Here's a custom Vulnerability Checklist & Script Toolkit to help you catch commonly missed vulnerabilities in web apps:

✅ Custom Checklist for Missed Vulnerabilities
1. Business Logic Flaws
 Try skipping steps (e.g., payment, verification)

 Attempt privilege escalation by modifying roles or flags

 Test for limits (e.g., changing quantity to -1, price to 0)

2. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
 Replace all user_id, invoice_id, etc. with others

 Check authenticated vs unauthenticated behavior

 Use Autorize Burp extension for automation

3. Client-side Bypass
 Remove JavaScript-based restrictions

 Modify form values and headers via Burp/Repeater

 Re-validate all client-side validated fields on server side

4. SSRF
 Inject http://127.0.0.1, http://169.254.169.254 into image/pdf generators

 Use requestbin or Burp Collaborator to detect outbound requests

5. Race Condition
 Use turbo intruder or custom scripts:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Simple curl-based race condition test
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST https://target/apply_coupon -d "coupon=SAVE100" & done
6. Subdomain Takeover
 Enumerate subdomains (e.g., assetfinder, sublist3r)

 Check for NXDOMAIN or unlinked services

bash
Copy
Edit
# Example using subjack
subjack -w subdomains.txt -t 50 -timeout 30 -ssl -c fingerprints.json -v
7. Uncommon Sensitive Files
 Scan for:

bash
Copy
Edit
/.env
/.git/config
/config.json
/debug
/actuator
/.DS_Store
8. Weak JWT or Crypto
 Try none algorithm in JWT

 Use jwt_tool.py:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 jwt_tool.py -t <token> -S -C -d
9. Chained Vulnerabilities
 Combine low-risk findings (e.g., verbose error + SSRF + RCE)

 Look for open redirect + cookie injection

10. Logging and Monitoring
 Trigger alert-worthy actions (e.g., SQLi, brute force)

 Check for missing audit trails

Here’s a second list of often-overlooked vulnerabilities that even experienced penetration testers can miss during engagements:

⚠️ More Commonly Missed Vulnerabilities
11. DOM-Based XSS
Why it’s missed: Static scanners often fail here.

What to do: Use dom-xss-scanner or manually test scripts in browser DevTools.

12. Prototype Pollution
Why it’s missed: Happens in JavaScript-heavy apps (especially Node.js).

What to do: Test with payloads like:

json
Copy
Edit
{"__proto__":{"admin":true}}
Use ppfuzz or synk-proto-pollution-scanner.

13. Cache Poisoning
Why it’s missed: Needs edge case analysis.

What to do: Try injecting headers like:

http
Copy
Edit
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
X-Original-URL: /admin
14. CSP Bypass
Why it’s missed: Most testers don't fully analyze Content-Security-Policy headers.

What to do: Use csp-evaluator and test known bypasses (inline scripts, trusted sources).

15. WebSocket Insecurity
Why it’s missed: Tools often skip WS/WSS endpoints.

What to do: Use Burp with WebSocket history. Look for:

Missing auth

Sensitive data leakage

IDOR inside WebSocket traffic

16. Clickjacking
Why it’s missed: Often marked as “low,” but can lead to real attacks.

What to do: Check for missing X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors.

17. Deserialization Attacks
Why it’s missed: Needs code-level knowledge or fuzzing.

What to do: Use ysoserial (Java), PHPGGC (PHP), or test binary objects.

18. Path Normalization / Bypass
Why it’s missed: Filters often bypassed using encoded chars.

What to do:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /..%2fadmin
GET /%2e%2e/admin
19. OAuth/OpenID Misconfigurations
Why it’s missed: Involves external auth services.

What to do:

Try login CSRF

Attempt token reuse across accounts

Abuse “redirect_uri” parameter

20. Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Logs or Uploads
Why it’s missed: Not tested in combination with log injection.

What to do:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Inject log and include it
User-Agent: <?php system('id'); ?>
# Then request:
GET /index.php?page=../../../../var/log/apache2/access.log

Absolutely — here’s a third batch of high-value, commonly missed vulnerabilities with practical tips:

⚠️ Even More Rarely Detected Vulnerabilities
21. JWT Key Confusion / Key Injection
Why it’s missed: Happens when servers accept both HS256 and RS256 algorithms.

What to do:

Try changing algorithm from RS256 to HS256 and sign with public key.

22. SAML Authentication Bypass
Why it’s missed: Complex XML structures, often blindly trusted.

What to do:

Try replaying assertions.

Flip NameID or manipulate NotBefore/NotOnOrAfter.

23. Blind XPath Injection
Why it’s missed: Looks like normal input errors; no visual output.

What to do:

bash
Copy
Edit
' or 1=1 or ''='
' or name()='admin' and '1'='1
24. Password Reset Poisoning
Why it’s missed: Header injection into reset URL logic.

What to do:

Inject Host: headers:

http
Copy
Edit
Host: attacker.com
25. CORS Misconfigurations
Why it’s missed: Only verified against *.

What to do:

Send Origin: https://evil.com

See if Access-Control-Allow-Origin reflects it.

26. Email Spoofing via SPF/DMARC Misconfig
Why it’s missed: Requires DNS inspection, not app testing.

What to do:

Use dmarcian, MXToolbox, or spf-check tools to validate records.

27. Abusing PDF/Doc Uploads for Malware
Why it’s missed: Assumed to be just file upload testing.

What to do:

Inject malicious macro/scripts and test if the file is processed or executed server-side (e.g., PDF renderers).

28. Hidden Parameters / Forced Browsing
Why it’s missed: Parameters hidden in JS, not in forms.

What to do:

Use ParamMiner (Burp plugin)

Test hidden endpoints like /admin, /test, /debug

29. Abuse of Cloud Metadata Services
Why it’s missed: Only SSRF into internal IPs tested.

What to do:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
Target AWS, GCP, Azure metadata endpoints.

30. Browser-Based Exploits (Universal XSS / UXSS)
Why it’s missed: Needs browser-level payload crafting.

What to do:

Test malformed iframes or script URIs inside extensions/web views.
